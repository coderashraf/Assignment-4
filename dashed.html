  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
    <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
    <li><strong><span class="striked-text">Css is not necessary</span><span class="ol-bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span></strong>It can control the layout of multiple pages all at once</li>
    <li><span class="li-italic">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML emelents</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a style element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span class="ul-bg">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
  <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
  <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
